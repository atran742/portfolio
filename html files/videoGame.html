    <h3 class="SaguaroText2">A 2D platformer game developed in Unity with the Aztec Game Lab. The
        game is about a kangaroo rat traversing the Saguaro desert as it collects resources
        such as cactus spikes and seeds to defeat the snake boss. The project was completed with
        a group of 40 other people and is available on itch.io. I was a level designer for the project
        and was in charge of sketching out the main level as well as determining the player values
        such as jump height and speed.

        <p class="heistDis">A 2D top down game created with Unity in a team of 4 people.
        The game allows for players to traverse an abandoned bank taken over by robots
        as they steal cash and try to avoid getting caught by any robots. I contributed
        as programmer, level designer, art, and story for this project. </p>
