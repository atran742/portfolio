        <h2>Surveillance research project </h2>
        <p class="heistDis"> A project created with 2 people investigates how law enforcement agencies across the U.S use surveillance technologies, as well as what it means for public privacy. Using our four datasets, we were able to create graphs and visualizations.
            We used visualization and SQL to find trends and patterns in our datasets. Using Random Forests for our classification model, we calculated the probability that each Technology would be used by a type of Law Enforcement Agency.
            We used F1 scores to check the precision and recall of our model.
