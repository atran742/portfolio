    <h2>The Wavelength Game</h2>
    <p class="heistDis"> A guessing game where players are given two options and a number and must give a good hint that best aligns with that number. For example, the prompt "savory vs sweet." Given the number 15 on a scale from 1-20, an answer like "peanut butter" would most make sense. Savory associated with lower numbers and sweet being associated with the numbers closer to 20.
